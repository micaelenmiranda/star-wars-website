# :milky_way: Star Wars Website

_"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..."_

A simple website developed as my first attempt to learn [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The application get informations about each classic movie from the Star Wars public API (https://swapi.dev/api/films/).

[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) were also used to build the layout.
